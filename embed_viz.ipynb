        "PCA focuses on capturing global linear relationships, meaning that it best reflects how points relate to the entire dataset, instead of local neighbors. That's why PCA is notably less dispersed than t-SNE and UMAP in the visualizations above.  \n",
        "\n",
        "t-SNE, on the other hand, focuses on preserving local relationships. This means that it is far better at identifying groups and clusters of similar datapoints. However, it does not preserve the distance between these clusters well.  For example, in the above visualization, \"high,\" \"top,\" \"tall\" are clustered together next to the cluster of \"versions\" and \"original.\" The relationship between points within these clusters are clear, but the closeness of the two clusters likely does not tell us about their relationship as groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally UMAP utilizes non-linear dimension reduction to create clusters, which allows it to capture more complex relationships. It also attempts to preserve global structures, which allows for a better understanding of how clusters relate to each other than t-SNE. It can be employed to illuminate more complex (non-linear) relationships and balance local and global fidelity."
